                <p>From a college student with a dream of owning a restaurant to
                    the grand openeing this past year, our goal has always been the same;
                    great food for an even better town. Born and raised here in Geneva,
                    IL, owner Cheyenne Vieau has alwasy wanted to give back to the
                    community that rasied her. What a better way to do that than with food!
                    From our local farms right to your table, we wake up every morning with
                    hopes of you joining us for the most important meal of the day!
